# Anti-Procrastinator
This application is intended to fight procrastination by redirecting the user whenever they open a new tab to a page that promotes productivityn like a student's google calendar. 

This chrome extension works by having a pop-up that allows you to copy and paste a url and save it. When a new tab is opened it redirects you to the saved URL. It utilizes chrom's synch storage so the url is saved to your chrome log-in, and is not local. 

Installation:
download the Anti-Procrastinator.crx file and drag and drop it into your chrome extensions page. Allow it to install and you are done.
